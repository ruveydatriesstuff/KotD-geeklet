# KotD-geeklet
Joyo Kanji of the Day geeklet for [GeekTool](https://www.tynsoe.org/v2/geektool/). 

RSS feed of Kanji of the Day belongs to [dperkins](https://github.com/dper/kanjioftheday). These geeklets simply get the Kanji and the examples from the RSS feed and add them on your desktop. 

I personally prefer refreshing it manually, so it is adjusted not to auto-refresh.
